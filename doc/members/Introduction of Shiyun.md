                           Introduction of Shiyun
  My name is Shiyun Chen, a first year MLIS students. I focus on archives and digital curation. I am very glad and excited to contribute to DCIC Human Face Project and participate in this fabulous team. The most important part that I admire of this project is the value of culture and the respect of history. I'm also eager to learn the knowledge and function of database design and data analysis. I hope I can find some history facts and acquire culture value that may help others from data.
